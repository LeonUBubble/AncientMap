# AncientMap
This is a WebSite Development for drawing map reconstruction based on Spring Boot and Mybaits.
Future work need to be down is about utilize OpenLayer Api to draw polygon and lines. And to gather those data.


Function in current website:

  Can support upload csv data only for point.
  Display map, delete map, Update map.
  
Future Work:

  Support more elementType like polygon and line.
  Visualize the geographical information by OpenLayer rather than Echarts.
  Change the database design. To make it more extensible. We will store data in database like csv.
  Add layer control function.
  After change the database design. Display CSV data in our interface to help user browse their data. Support operation in the meantime.
